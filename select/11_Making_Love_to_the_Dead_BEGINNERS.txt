Come round bring me down like the old days
And it's sexy, oh, the color of the cocaine
Deep in five my desire and I took the bait
I wanted go but I know that's too late
Darling go, watch your head
Don't look down baby under the bed
Let it show, what you read
Underground making love to the dead
De, de, de, de, dead
I read the crowd like a clown on the prominence
Dripping wet with regret and some hot cake
Strip down back abound would you like a taste
On the floor gimme more don't you hesitate
Darling go, watch your head
Don't look down baby under the bed
Let it show, what you read
Underground making love to the dead
De, de, de, de, dead
Darling go, watch your head
Don't look down baby under the bed
Let it show, what you read
Underground making love to the dead
De, de, de, de, dead
